## ‚ú® Features

* ‚úÖ Read contents of `.doc`, `.docx`, `.txt`, and `.json` files
* ‚úÖ Simple and synchronous file reading
* ‚úÖ Helpful console output for debugging and clarity
* ‚úÖ Zero dependency (only built-in `fs` and `path` modules)

---

## üì• Installation

```bash
npm install text-find
```

---

## üìö Usage

### 1. Import the package

```js
const file = require('text-find');
```

### 2. Use the function with a supported file path

```js
const filePath = 'example.docx'; // or .doc, .txt, .json
file(filePath);
```

### ‚úÖ Example

Let's say you have a file named `data.docx` that contains the text:

```
Hello World
```

Your JavaScript file:

```js
const file = require('text-find');

const filePath = 'data.docx';

file(filePath);
```

**Console Output:**

```
üìÑ File read: data.docx
Hello World
```

---

## üìù Supported File Formats

* `.doc`
* `.docx`
* `.txt`
* `.json`

If you try to read an unsupported file type, you'll receive an error message like:

```
‚ùå Unsupported file formats: .pdf
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

* The current version reads `.doc` and `.docx` files as **buffers**, which may not always render readable text, especially for `.docx`. You might consider integrating packages like `mammoth` or `docx-parser` if you need structured parsing of Word documents.
* This package is **synchronous** (`fs.readFileSync`) for simplicity.
